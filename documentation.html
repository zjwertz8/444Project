            <h1>Inspiration</h1>

<p class="body-content">
Our team approached this topic with two goals in mind - create something that is genuinely useful to solve a problem, and have that problem be local. We were worried that if we chose a problem first, we would end up looking for a corresponding data set that would be predisposed to supporting our hypothesis. Consequently, we decided we wanted to try and find a dataset large enough to be an accurate representation of the population first. Then, we would use what weâ€™ve learned about information visualization to see if we could bring to light any trends among that data that were not already obvious.
</p>

<p class="body-content">
We traversed campus, speaking to multiple different departments and programs to explain our project. Ultimately, we received a dataset of parking tickets from the Parking and Transportation Services department.
</p>

<h1>
The Data
</h1>
<p class="body-content">
Due to privacy concerns, Parking and Transportation Services had to redact some of the data. We received 179284 tickets from 2014 to October 5th, 2017. Many of the tickets were voided and not considered.
</p>
<p class="body-content">
In our representation of the data, we used the location by parking lot of each ticket as well as its date to create our visualizations.
</p>
<h1>What it does</h1>
<p class="body-content">
Our application allows the user to view a heatmap representing the density of parking tickets across campus.
